# Arduino Class Maker Example Files

1) This is a typical Arduino Program. It accomplishes its task, but  is messy and hard to read. Files 2,3, and 4 are made by our program to fix those problems

2) This is the Body of the class generated by our application. It abstracts the mechanics of how the first program works.

3) This is the header of the class generated by our application, it provides an outline of the background program and makes variables private (a good programming practice).

4) This is the simplified example sketch automatically generated by our program. It just asks the background program to d the different tasks, and leaves the user to think about higher level problems such as when to do them.

The Gif demonstrated the tool working in the Arduino IDE, just one click!
